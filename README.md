# DeltaHacks-Space-Run-GAME
This Project was started for DeltaHacks 9 and it is a 2D Scroll Game starring an Astronaut! 

TLDR: Using Javascript and HTML to display and create a fun web game similar to classic games like Mario and Donkey Kong.

<h2>Background</h2>

This project was made during DeltaHacks 9 2023 to serve as a start to creating a web-based 2D scroll game. Wanting to explore using JavaScript and creating a web game this was the perfect project to start what I hope to be a continued project moving forward. The idea of the game comes from classic 2D scroll games like Mario, Donkey Kong, and Flappy Bird.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

Using VSCode Liveserver the game can run locally hosted in any browser. The game uses customized images, artificial physics, sprite creation, and parralax scrolling to create the moving effects. 

<h2>Requirements</h2>

To recreate this project you will need the following software:
- VSCode
- VSCode LiveServer Extension 
- JavaScript and HTML
- Any Browser to Run Game The On 


<h2>Steps to Replicate</h2>

1. Clone the repository
	```sh git clone https://github.com/nickoenig37/DeltaHacks-Space-Run-GAME.git```
2. Install VSCode and The Live Server Extension
3. Make sure you have a web browser to run the game on
4. Right click on the HTML File and open it using Live Server```



<h2>Next Steps</h2>

There are many things that we can do to improve on this project for the future, including:
- Creating more levels 
- Implementing a State Machine to create different transitions based on outcomes (Starting game, winning level, dying...)
- Adding Different Sprites for different levels and themes
- Uploading the game to a domain
- Possibly tracking scores
